# The JavaScript Turning point

## Flavor of the week

When I "came up" as a Web Developer 5(ish) years ago, it was simpler times. Sure we had to deal with IE6, but we had JQuery to help us. Matter of fact, jQuery was all the JavaScript I needed.  In recent years, the JavaScript community has earned a reputation of extreme fickleness. JQuery is dead; its now the era of *the Single Page Application*.

Just get a grasp on Backbone? That was so last week. Now you need to know Angular. I mean React. Finally grokking RequireJS? Well no one uses *that* anymore. Use ~Browserify~ SystemJS. Are you building your front-end code with Grunt yet? Wait. Grunt died last week. Long live Gulp.

Joking aside, it is undeniable that JavaScript, and front-end development in general, is currently undergoing massive change.

## Why so much change?

## Calmer waters ahead
