Dilbert Laws

This is Dilbert. Dilbert is a programer. He works every day from 9 to 6 with a one hour lunch. He is good at his job, but the world is out to make his job difficult. These are his stories. 
	Dilbert project is running late and is called into his bosses  office. His boss asks Dilbert how many more developers will be needed to complete this project. Dilbert tries to convince his boss that no number of people will make this project onetime but rather make it later and later. His boss wont have it and assigns him 4 new developers. 
	Little does filberts boss now but he just broke Brook's Law: "Adding more programmers to a late project makes it later."
