# The JavaScript Turning point

## Flavor of the week

When I "came up" as a Web Developer 5(ish) years ago, it was simpler times. Sure we had to deal with IE6, but we had JQuery to help us. Matter of fact, jQuery was all the JavaScript I needed.  In recent years, the JavaScript community has earned a reputation of extreme fickleness. JQuery is dead; its now the era of *the Single Page Application*.

Just get a grasp on Backbone? That was so last week. Now you need to know Angular. I mean React. Finally grokking RequireJS? Well no one uses *that* anymore. Use ~Browserify~ SystemJS. Are you building your front-end code with Grunt yet? Wait. Grunt died last week. Long live Gulp.

Joking aside, it is undeniable that JavaScript, and front-end development in general, is currently undergoing massive change.

## Why so much change?

### Because JavaScript sucks!

Well, it doesn't suck, but it's pretty much the most popular coding language in the world, and it was cobbled together by just one guy in little over a single week back in the early 90s. And it hasn't changed much since.

JavaSCript *couldn't* change, in part because old browsers just wouldn't die. Internet Explorer 6 had significant market share for over 10 years. In the last couple years, many of us have been able to drop support for IE6, IE7, and even IE8. New browsers from all the major vendors are *Evergreen*. That is, they update themselves!

In short, we only now are able to change JavaSCript. We're able to use the new Hawtness because its actually supported on the devices our users have. And we can think ahead, because change can happen in a reasonable timeframe.

### Atwood's Law

> any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript

 - *[Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/)*

As computers get faster, and browsers get better, the front-end can do more.

## Calmer waters ahead

We've seen a proliferation of JavaScript tools and frameworks because we're still trying to figure this stuff out. But we're getting there. I perdict that we soon will see a convergence. I think its already begun.
