# Trials and Tribulations of an Open Source Noob

This is the story of my first real open source project.

Early in my career as a *Web Developer*, before I had a "real" job in the industry, I was working on a website for a friend's small business. It was to be a simple site, with the most complicated feature being an image gallery. He wanted to be able to update said gallery himself. I had a few options:

 - Build his site with a CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc...)
 - Build a custom backend
 - Teach my friend to use FTP

While considering these options, a thought came to me:

My friend already has a Facebook page for his business. The Facebook page has a gallery.

Even if I build the website with a fancy backend, my friend would have to update 2 different galleries using two different systems every time he has a new photo he wants show off.

*Maybe* something exists that I can use to embed a Facebook album into a Website.

I put in some serious time researching this question. Yes, it had been done. In a sense. I found a few plugins for different CMS's, one pay-for PHP script on CodeCanyon, and a couple StackOverflow posts discussing the Facebook APIs required to access this content. I also found a couple different, and quite long, message board threads where people were looking for a good solution to embedding Facebook albums on a static web-page.

This was the turning point.
