A few days back I was peering with Zach my  college and we  ran into an interesting situation, what follows is my recollection of the events as best as I can.



While attempting to add a new feature to a  preexisting  class we discovered that the class  could stand to  be refactored. The class over time had become the system’s  junk draw and the interface was cluttered with all sorts of  unrelated methods. We both agreed that the class was in need of refactoring but we couldn't  invasion the others proposed solution. At the time we simply lacked a good way to communicate the idea we each had.  After a few minutes of back and forth at the white board I looked to my partner and said “do you trust me?” to which   he  nodded yes. After witnessing his approval, I reached over and drove for a few minutes and roughed out my idea while Zach silently watched. After roughing out my idea I was more easily able to convey my idea. 



Upon seeing my solution Zach smiled and returned the question “do you trust me?”. I immediately answered yes (fair is fair). Zach then commenced to create a new branch and committed my code leaving our original branch to its original state. Zach then set off and set off to prototype his solution while I watched on eagerly.



In the end, the final solution was composed of aspects from both solutions. Neither one of use on our own devised an elegant solution. It was our willingness to trust the other person and allow them to drive  unmolested  and our  willingness  to throw away our own idea that allowed us to write good software.
